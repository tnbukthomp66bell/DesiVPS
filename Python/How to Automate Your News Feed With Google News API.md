## Practical Steps to Build an Automated News Feed

### Step 1: Registration and Authentication

Start by visiting the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) to register your account. Create a new project, enable the Google News API, and generate an API key to authenticate your requests.

### Step 2: Writing the Request Code

Use a programming language like Python with the `requests` library to send GET requests to the API. Below is a sample code snippet:

```python
import requests

api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
url = f'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey={api_key}'
response = requests.get(url)
articles = response.json()['articles']

for article in articles:
    print(article['title'])
```

### Step 3: Customizing the Filtering Logic

Based on your business needs, you can include additional parameters in the API request URL, such as:

- `q`: For keyword-specific searches.
- `category`: To filter by news categories (e.g., technology, sports).
