# Analyzing E-Commerce CRM: Effective Customer Data Collection Strategies



E-commerce is a diverse field with many forms beyond just B2C. While B2C represents only 30% of China's e-commerce market, the remaining 70% is dominated by B2B. Misunderstanding the scope of e-commerce is commonâ€”some equate it solely to small sellers on platforms like Taobao, while others include services like search ranking by companies such as Baidu. However, it's important to clarify that platforms like Baidu are more accurately categorized as traffic vendors rather than direct e-commerce service providers.

For B2B and B2C e-commerce platforms, their customers primarily consist of merchants who leverage the platform for advertising or better search rankings. Supporting services like logistics, payment solutions, marketing, and media also play a crucial role in the e-commerce ecosystem. Identifying who pays for these services provides clarity on who your actual customers are.

## CRM: The Foundation of Customer-Centric Strategies

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) begins with a foundational question: Who are your customers? The answer lies in identifying those who directly pay for your services. This understanding sets the stage for building a customer-centric strategy that ensures sustainable business growth.

### Real-Life Examples of CRM in Action

1. **The Neglectful Influencer**  
   A social media influencer, despite amassing thousands of followers, neglects fan interactions. They lose engagement by failing to build meaningful connections with their audience. This highlights the importance of managing and nurturing relationships, even in seemingly non-commercial settings like social media.

2. **The Big Data Confusion**  
   A content manager, tasked with building a data-driven project, struggles to find direction despite familiarity with the concept of "big data." The solution involves collecting as much data as possible, categorizing it, and brainstorming to identify actionable insights.

These examples underscore that CRM starts with gathering and understanding data. Without comprehensive data collection, businesses risk making decisions based on incomplete or irrelevant information.

## Steps to Collect Customer Data for CRM

The first step in CRM is data collection. Gathering diverse and relevant customer data enables better engagement and decision-making. However, this is often where many businesses face challenges.

### Types of Customer Data to Collect

1. **Basic Information**  
   - Name, company, contact details (phone, email, social accounts).  
   - Professional titles, income levels, industry standing, and relationship networks.

2. **Subjective Preferences**  
   - Customer likes and dislikes, brand preferences, and purchasing habits.  
   - Privacy and interference tolerance, loyalty program participation.

3. **Transaction Records**  
   - Purchase history, including competitor data if available.  
   - Records of customer support interactions, complaints, and returns.  

### Collection Channels and Strategies

1. **Internal Channels**  
   - Gather data from inquiries, sales visits, and transactional communications.

2. **External Channels**  
   - Direct contact via calls, emails, or social media.  
   - Indirect methods like third-party surveys and online research.

### Tips for Effective Data Collection

- Be comprehensive but respect privacy boundaries.
- Avoid setting rigid KPIs for data collection teams to maintain quality.
- Encourage discussions about collected data within teams.
- Focus on fresh, relevant, and actionable data.
- Start small, leveraging tools like Excel before scaling with specialized CRM software.

## Common Mistakes in CRM Implementation

Many e-commerce businesses mistakenly view CRM as a quick fix or magic tool. This mindset often leads to poor implementation and underwhelming results. Without a solid foundation of accurate customer data, even the best CRM systems will fail to deliver meaningful outcomes.

For example, a small Taobao seller might focus solely on competitors without analyzing their own customer base. Such an approach overlooks the opportunity to strengthen relationships with existing clients and build long-term loyalty.

## Conclusion

CRM is not just a system; it's a customer-centric operational strategy. By prioritizing data collection and understanding customer behavior, businesses can implement effective CRM practices that drive long-term success. Collecting customer data may be challenging, but it lays the groundwork for deeper insights and better decision-making.
