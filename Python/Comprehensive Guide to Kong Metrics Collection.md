# Comprehensive Guide to Kong Metrics Collection

Kong is a powerful microservice API gateway that simplifies the management of APIs in complex microservice architectures. It acts as a centralized access point, handling operations such as security, load balancing, rate limiting, circuit breaking, and more. By aggregating APIs across various microservices, Kong provides a unified interface to external users while protecting backend services.

## Why Use Kong for Metrics?

Kong facilitates efficient monitoring and management of APIs, ensuring performance and reliability across services. To streamline monitoring, Kong integrates seamlessly with **Prometheus**, a leading monitoring and alerting toolkit. The Prometheus plugin, bundled with Kong, enables the collection and visualization of key performance metrics from Kong and its upstream services.

## Setting Up the Prometheus Plugin

### Compatibility with DB-Less Mode

Kong's Prometheus plugin is fully compatible with DB-less mode, allowing you to configure Kong declaratively. This mode focuses on managing configurations via files rather than databases. Note that metrics related to database connectivity will always report a healthy status in DB-less mode.

### Enabling the Prometheus Plugin

You can enable the Prometheus plugin either through Kongâ€™s **Admin API** or management tools like KongA. Below is an example of enabling the plugin via Admin API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://{HOST}:8001/plugins/ \
    --data "name=prometheus"
```

Alternatively, if you're using a management tool, navigate to the **Plugins** section, search for "Prometheus," and enable it.

### Plugin Configuration Parameters

The plugin allows several configurations for fine-tuning your metrics collection:

- **`name`**: (String) Plugin name, e.g., `prometheus`.
- **`service.id`**: (String) ID of the service to which the plugin is linked.
- **`enabled`**: (Boolean) Specifies whether the plugin is active. Default: `true`.
- **`config.per_consumer`**: (Boolean) Collect metrics per consumer. Default: `false`.

#### New Features in Version 1.4.x:
- **`data_plane_cluster_cert_expiry_timestamp`**: Tracks the expiration date of the data plane cluster certificate.
- **Subsystem Label for Upstream Targets**: Adds a `subsystem` label to health status metrics for better granularity.

## Metrics Available in Kong

The Prometheus plugin exposes several key metrics, enabling comprehensive monitoring of Kong and its upstream services. Below is a breakdown of the most important metrics:

### 1. **Status Codes**
   - Tracks HTTP response codes from upstream services.
   - Metrics are available for:
     - Individual services
     - All services
     - Specific consumers

### 2. **Latency Histograms**
   - Measures time delays across various stages of a request:
     - **Request**: Total time for Kong and the upstream service to process the request.
     - **Kong**: Time taken by Kong to route requests and execute plugins.
     - **Upstream**: Time taken by upstream services to process the request.

### 3. **Bandwidth**
   - Tracks total data ingress and egress through Kong for individual services and as a whole.

### 4. **Database Reachability**
   - A binary metric (0 or 1) indicating whether Kong can connect to the database.

### 5. **Nginx Connections**
   - Metrics related to Nginx connections, including active, reading, writing, and idle connections.

### 6. **Target Health**
   - Monitors the health status of upstream targets, including:
     - Healthy
     - Unhealthy
     - DNS errors
     - Health checks disabled

### 7. **Data Plane Status**
   - Tracks data plane metrics, including:
     - Last reported timestamp
     - Configuration hash
     - Certificate expiry timestamps

### 8. **Enterprise License Information**
   - Displays Kong Gateway license details, including expiration and enabled features.

## Example Metrics Output

You can fetch Kongâ€™s Prometheus metrics by querying the `/metrics` endpoint. Below is a sample output:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8001/metrics
```

Sample response:
```plaintext
# HELP kong_bandwidth Total bandwidth in bytes consumed per service/route in Kong
# TYPE kong_bandwidth counter
kong_bandwidth{type="egress",service="google",route="google.route-1"} 1277
kong_bandwidth{type="ingress",service="google",route="google.route-1"} 254

# HELP kong_http_status HTTP status codes per service/route in Kong
# TYPE kong_http_status counter
kong_http_status{code="200",service="service-1",route="route-1"} 15

# HELP kong_latency Latency added by Kong, total request time and upstream latency
# TYPE kong_latency histogram
kong_latency_bucket{type="request",service="service-1",route="route-1",le="00300.0"} 8
kong_latency_bucket{type="kong",service="service-1",route="route-1",le="00001.0"} 2
```

### Key Sections in the Metrics Output

1. **Bandwidth Metrics**: Provides insights into total traffic flow.
2. **Latency Metrics**: Highlights performance bottlenecks between Kong and upstream services.
3. **Status Code Metrics**: Tracks success and error rates across services.
4. **Connection Metrics**: Monitors Nginx server performance.
