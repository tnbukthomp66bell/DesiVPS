## Pricing and Variations

### Why Charge Per Row and Not Per Product?

If products have variations (e.g., different sizes or colors), each variation is treated as a separate row. Variations require additional configuration, and files with many variations grow in complexity. Thus, pricing is based on the number of rows in the output file.

## Scraping Large Websites with Millions of Products

Scraping extensive websites like eBay requires additional considerations:

1. **Chunking Data**  
   Large datasets are scraped in chunks to prevent bans and manage file sizes.

2. **Proxies and Speed**  
   Proxies help avoid detection. Faster delivery requires more servers, which may increase costs.

3. **Approval for Additional Work**  
   Any tweaks requiring additional work will be quoted and approved before proceeding.

## Legal Considerations for Web Scraping

### Can Someone Copy My Work Through Scraping?

Protect your website by consulting a legal representative, applying copyright marks, using robots.txt, and watermarking content. Use tools like [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) to monitor unauthorized use of your content.

### Is Automated Data Collection Legal?

Automated scraping is generally legal if you have permission from the data owner. For example, scraping product details from a manufacturer who has granted you permission is acceptable.

### How to Use Scraped Data Legally?

- Always respect copyright laws and website Terms of Service (ToS).  
- Avoid passing off scraped content as your own. Duplicate content can harm SEO and potentially lead to penalties.
