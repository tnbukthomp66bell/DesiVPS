## Introduction

The goal of every web scraper is to blend seamlessly into a website's normal traffic. However, avoiding detection has become increasingly challenging as anti-bot technologies grow more sophisticated.

In this guide, we'll explore common ways websites detect scrapers and share techniques to help your scraper blend into regular traffic and avoid getting blocked.

## Header Optimization

Optimizing your headers is one of the most critical steps to prevent your scraper from being detected. Headers provide information about the client making the request, and websites often use them to identify scrapers.

### 1. Use Real Web Browser Headers

Most HTTP libraries, such as Python's `requests` or Node.js' `axios`, either don't include headers that mimic real browsers or provide headers that reveal the library being used. Both scenarios immediately flag your request as automated. 

Ensure your scraper uses real browser headers and varies them for each request. For instance, hereâ€™s an example of headers for Chrome on macOS:

```json
{
  "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36",
  "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8",
  "Accept-Language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
  "Connection": "keep-alive"
}
```

### 2. Pay Attention to Header Order

Web browsers send headers in a specific order. However, many HTTP clients randomize header order or fail to respect it, making your requests suspicious. For example, Python's `requests` library randomizes header order, while `httpx` respects it. Choose a library that allows you to match the browser's header order exactly.

### 3. Optimize Headers for Specific Websites

Certain websites may require specific headers to access certain pages or improve scraping performance. For example, setting the `Referer` header to `facebook.com` instead of `google.com` may increase success rates. Proxy services like [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) optimize headers and test combinations to maximize performance.

### Takeaways

- Use real browser headers and user-agent combinations.  
- Choose an HTTP client that respects header order.  
- Optimize headers based on the target website's requirements.

## IP Addresses and Proxies

To scrape websites at scale or speed, you'll need proxies to avoid detection based on your IP address. Websites monitor the frequency and patterns of requests, and exceeding these thresholds can result in IP bans.

### Proxy Options

Here are the common types of proxies you can use:

1. **Free Proxy Lists**  
   While free, these proxies are unreliable and often overused.

2. **Datacenter Proxies**  
   High-speed but easier to detect as non-residential.

3. **Residential Proxies**  
   Use real user IPs, making them harder to detect but more expensive.

4. **Mobile Proxies**  
   Provide IPs from mobile networks, offering the highest level of anonymity.

5. **Proxy APIs**  
   Tools like [ScraperAPI](https://bit.ly/Scraperapi) automate proxy management, rotation, and handling of CAPTCHAs.

6. **Building Your Own Proxy Network**  
   Requires significant infrastructure and ongoing management.

### Proxy Management

Regardless of the proxy type, you'll need a system to:

- Rotate proxies  
- Detect and blacklist blocked proxies  
- Diversify your IP pool across subnets

### Takeaways

- Proxies are essential for large-scale scraping.  
- Use a diverse pool of proxies.  
- Implement a robust proxy management system.

## Request Profiling

The structure and behavior of your requests are key indicators of whether you're a scraper or a real user. Scraping at a consistent rate or in a predictable pattern can quickly give you away.

### 1. Unrealistic URLs

Avoid using URLs that real users wouldnâ€™t typically access. For example:

- **Suspicious**: `https://www.shop.com/product/[product_id]`  
- **Realistic**: `https://www.walmart.com/ip/Surface-Bassu-Moisture-Conditioner-2-oz-Pack-of-2/643905888`  

### 2. Request Patterns

Requesting pages in sequential order or at a constant rate is a dead giveaway. Instead, randomize the pages you scrape and vary the intervals between requests.

### 3. Location

Use proxies located in regions where the target websiteâ€™s real users are based. For example, avoid using Russian proxies to scrape a South American real estate platform.

### Takeaways

- Use realistic URLs that mimic real user behavior.  
- Randomize scraping patterns and intervals.  
- Match the geographic location of your requests with the website's target audience.

## Browser Fingerprinting

Using headless browsers like Puppeteer, Playwright, or Selenium can make your scraper appear more like a real user. However, they introduce their own challenges, as websites employ advanced techniques like browser fingerprinting.

### 1. Fixing Browser Leaks

Headless browsers often leak information that reveals they're automated. Use stealth versions, such as `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth`, to patch these leaks and fortify your browser fingerprint.

### 2. Consistent Identity

Ensure that your headers, user-agent, browser type, operating system, and proxy location all match. For example, avoid using a Linux server with a Windows user-agent, as this inconsistency will raise red flags.

### Takeaways

- Headless browsers can improve performance but aren't foolproof.  
- Fix browser leaks and maintain consistent identities to avoid detection.

## Conclusion

Web scraping without getting blocked requires careful attention to headers, proxies, request patterns, and browser behavior. By implementing these strategies, you can maximize the efficiency and success of your scraping projects.
