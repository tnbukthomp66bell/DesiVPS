## What Is Web Query and How Does It Work?

Web Query is an Excel feature that extracts data from websites directly into spreadsheets. It requires no coding knowledge and works by rendering the target webpage in Excelâ€™s built-in browser (Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer). It identifies and highlights data tables, which you can select to import into your Excel sheet.

### Benefits of Using Web Query

- **No coding required** â€“ Perfect for beginners.
- **Effortless table extraction** â€“ Ideal for structured data like tables and lists.
- **Dynamic website rendering** â€“ Handles JavaScript-heavy websites.
- **Automatic data refresh** â€“ Keeps your data up-to-date.
- **Built-in analysis tools** â€“ Seamlessly integrates into Excel.

Web Query is best suited for extracting tabular, public data into Excel, though it has limitations for advanced scraping needs.

## Refreshing and Updating Scraped Data

Web Query allows you to easily update scraped data with the latest information from the source website.

## Limitations of Web Query

While Web Query is convenient, it has its drawbacks:

1. **Limited to HTML tables** â€“ Cannot extract unstructured data.
2. **No advanced scraping features** â€“ Lacks pagination handling and automation.
3. **No proxies** â€“ Susceptible to IP blocking during large-scale scraping.
