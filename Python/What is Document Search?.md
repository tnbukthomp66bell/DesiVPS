# What is Document Search?

Document search refers to searching unstructured free text (not just documents). Whether you‚Äôre browsing websites, searching for products, or using curated content, search engines make it possible. You type your query into a search box, click "Search," and (ideally) receive relevant results aligned with your informational needs.

Search engines originate from database technologies, storing and processing data queries. While traditional databases primarily manage structured data organized into tables and columns, search engines handle structured and unstructured data (documents). They employ language rules to break down text into matching terms, ranking results to display the best matches first. Unlike relational or NoSQL databases that retrieve **all** results, search engines focus on retrieving **the best** results.

### Key Applications of Search Engines:
1. **Document Search**: Designed for unstructured free text.
2. **E-commerce Search**: For mixed structured and unstructured data.
3. **Query Offloading**: Primarily for structured data.

## Challenges in Document Search

Document search faces two primary challenges: **data preparation and ingestion** and **search relevance**.

### 1. Data Preparation and Ingestion
The corpus of documents often consists of user-generated or unmanaged content, which may include:
- Spelling errors
- Redundancy
- Irrelevant or meaningless data

Before loading data into a search engine, it must be cleaned, normalized, and prepared. Afterward, the data is ingested using ingestion APIs, and a process must be implemented to update the corpus as documents evolve.

### 2. Search Relevance
Relevance is the core value of document search‚Äîretrieving documents that best match user queries. Search engines use algorithms like BM25 to score and rank results. BM25 evaluates query term uniqueness and frequency in the document. To improve relevance, scoring functions can be fine-tuned using machine learning (ML) techniques, ensuring the search yields the best results.

## Additional Search Use Cases

### 1. E-commerce Search
E-commerce search focuses on helping users find and purchase products within a catalog. Product data often includes metadata fields (e.g., size, color, brand) and longer fields like descriptions and reviews. The goal is to retrieve relevant results that drive sales.

#### Features:
- **Faceted Search**: Enables users to filter results using categories like size or color.
- **Personalization**: Tailors results based on user preferences and behavior.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Uses similarity metrics (e.g., k-NN) to suggest products customers may like.

### 2. Curated Dataset Search
Curated dataset search is used in repositories like clinical trial data, legal summaries, or real estate listings. Search engines use language rules and specific algorithms to break down text into searchable components, enabling complex query combinations (e.g., ‚Äúlong-sleeve dresses‚Äù).

---

### 3. Query Offloading
Search engines excel in high-volume, low-latency search due to data structures like inverted indexes, which map terms to documents containing them. While not relational, search engines often work alongside relational databases, combining their strengths to deliver robust search capabilities.

## Who Builds Document Search?

Creating an effective document search experience involves multiple roles:
- **Developers**: Implement search solutions and build interfaces.
- **Product Managers**: Define metadata structures and user experience requirements.
- **Data Scientists**: Manage source data and user behavior insights.
- **Executives**: Set business KPIs and guide teams toward achieving search engine goals.

## The Future of Document Search

Traditional keyword-based search matches terms like "8-foot sofa" by identifying individual words (e.g., "8," "foot," "sofa"). However, users often prefer to search by meaning, rather than exact terms‚Äîthis is where **semantic search** comes in.

### What is Semantic Search?
Semantic search leverages ML techniques to interpret the intent behind queries. For example:
- **Keyword Search**: Matches exact terms.
- **Semantic Search**: Matches queries like "a cozy spot for sitting by the fireplace" to results like "8-foot sofa."

Semantic search requires building vector spaces for entries and queries. Using vector similarity, even documents with no shared keywords can be matched. For instance, a search for "bicycle maintenance" might match a document about "gear lubrication," as ML models recognize their contextual relationship.

## Improving Search Relevance

Effective document and e-commerce search depend on relevance‚Äîhow well results meet users' needs. Here are techniques to enhance relevance:

1. **Weighted Fields**: Assign different weights to fields. For instance, in a movie database, prioritize matches in the `title` field over `actor` or `director`.

2. **Freshness Scoring**: Prioritize recent content by incorporating a `release_date` field and applying an exponential decay function in the scoring formula.

3. **Faceted Filtering**: Offer filters for metadata fields (e.g., categories) to let users refine results. These filters are often displayed in a sidebar.

4. **Synonyms**: Add synonym handling to capture variations in user queries. For example, a search for "t-shirt" should return the same results as "tee" or "teeshirt."

## Conclusion

Document search is evolving from simple keyword matching to advanced ML-driven semantic search. By combining structured data preparation with techniques like vector similarity and relevance scoring, search engines can deliver results that truly meet user intent. Whether for e-commerce, curated datasets, or semantic queries, investing in search relevance ensures an engaging and successful user experience.
